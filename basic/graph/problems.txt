Problems:
	Path. Is there a path between s and t ?
	Shortest path. What is the shortest path between s and t ?
	
	Cycle. Is there a cycle in the graph?
	Euler tour. Is there a cycle that uses each edge exactly once?
	Hamilton tour. Is there a cycle that uses each vertex exactly once.
	
	Connectivity. Is there a way to connect all of the vertices?
	MST. What is the best way to connect all of the vertices?
	Biconnectivity. Is there a vertex whose removal disconnects the graph?
	
	Planarity. Can you draw the graph in the plane with no crossing edges
	Graph isomorphism. Do two adjacency lists represent the same graph?
	
	Challenge. Which of these problems are easy? difficult? intractable?
	
Challanges:
1. Is a graph bipartite:
	simple DFS-based solution
	mark the vertices by flag
2. Find a cycle:
	simple DFS-based solution
3. Eluer tour: Is there a general cycle that uses each edge exactly once?
	Yes iff connected and all vertices have even degree
4. Find a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once?
	Hamiltonian Cycle, classical NP-complete problem
5. Are two graphs identical except for vertex names?
	Graph isomorphism is longstanding open problem
6. Layout a graph in the plane without crossing edges
	linear-time DFS-based planarity algorithm discovered by Tarjan in 1970
